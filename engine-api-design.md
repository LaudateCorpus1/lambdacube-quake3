# Engine API

### TODO:

- [x] allow attaching MD3s via tags
- [ ] ~~move game character and animation related code to game module~~ ; add animation and skin resources ; the engine should handle md3 models in general
- [ ] remove md3character ; add skin, animation resources
- [x] expose model and map collision information and query functions

### IDEA:

- allow resource quierying from game logic code ; this follows the c game logic design
