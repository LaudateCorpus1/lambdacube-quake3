# Engine API

### TODO:

- expose model and map collision information and query functions
- remove md3character ; add skin, animation resources
- allow attaching MD3s via tags
- move game character and animation related code to game module ; the engine should handle md3 models in general

### IDEA:

- allow resource quierying from game logic code ; this follows the c game logic design
